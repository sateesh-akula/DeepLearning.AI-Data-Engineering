# Data Engineering Specialization

This repository contains resources for the **Data Engineering Specialization**, a [MOOC offered by deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/data-engineering/) that provides a comprehensive guide to developing and deploying data systems that deliver real business value. It includes course subtitles and solutions to the lab exercises for all courses in the specialization.

### Specialization Overview

This specialization equips learners with the skills to approach data engineering problems systematically, focusing on the full data engineering lifecycle. Key topics include building effective data pipelines, designing scalable architectures, and applying data transformations to serve business needs.

### Courses in the Specialization

#### 1. Introduction to Data Engineering

- Think critically about the components of an end-to-end data architecture that satisfies requirements while remaining flexible for the future.
- Evaluate technologies and tools against the context of requirements and good data architecture.
- Design a data architecture and implement a batch and streaming pipeline on AWS.

#### 2. Source Systems, Data Ingestion, and Pipelines

- Identify data formats and appropriate source systems for various use cases.
- Differentiate between relational and NoSQL databases, and understand ACID compliance.
- Perform batch and streaming data ingestion using ETL and ELT patterns.
- Interact with REST APIs, object storage, and event-streaming platforms for ingestion.
- Learn DataOps concepts such as CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, and observability.
- Orchestrate data pipelines using Airflow and integrate data quality tests.

#### 3. Data Storage and Queries

- Explore storage systems (object, block, and file) and their impact on performance.
- Understand the differences between row-oriented and column-oriented databases.
- Learn about data warehouses, data lakes, and the lakehouse architecture.
- Implement advanced SQL queries and strategies for query performance optimization.
- Execute aggregate and join queries on streaming data.

#### 4. Data Modeling, Transformation, and Serving

- Define data modeling techniques and apply normalization to data.
- Understand warehouse modeling approaches (Inmon, Kimball, Data Vault) and transform data for analytics.
- Prepare tabular, textual, and image data for machine learning models.
- Compare batch and streaming transformation frameworks such as Spark and Pandas.
- Serve processed data to stakeholders using modern architectures.
